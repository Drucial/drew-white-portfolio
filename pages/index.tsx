						Thanks for visting my website! You are probably curious who I am. As
						you can see from the title above, I am a{" "}
						<span>UI/UX Design Engineer</span>. I think that&apos;s a pretty
						unusual title but basically, I love to <span>design </span>
						forward thinking, thoughtful, and exciting interfaces and
						experiences for mobile, desktop and the web...and I also like to{" "}
						<span>build</span> them!

					<Heading>Design Philosophy</Heading>
					<Text>
						I am a <span>minimalist</span> at heart and strongly believe that
						less is more in almost every situation. I love to push the boundries
						of convention while throwing familiar nods to users to take them on
						a satisfying journey. Analytics and research play a critical role in
						my approach to both UX and UI as they provide a rodemap for an{" "}
						<span>intuitive and elegant</span> feel that will invite users to
						feel right at home.

					<Heading>Design Tools</Heading>
					<Text>
						Today, I work through my design process in <span>Figma</span>.
						Prototypes are managed in Figma or a code sandbox like CodePen if
						there is substantial interaction design. Icons and graphics are
						handled in Adobe <span>Illustrator</span> and <span>Photoshop</span>{" "}
						respectively. Finally, for any 3D work or animations I prefer to
						work in <span>Cinema4D</span> using Octane Render.

					<Heading>Engineering Tools</Heading>
					<Text>
						My primary language is JavaScript, specifically{" "}
						<span>TypeScript</span>. These days I spend most of my time in React
						working with a wide range of libraries including NextJS,{" "}
						<span>Stitches</span> for styled components, <span>Recoil </span>
						for state managment, <span>FramerMotion</span> for all the good
						animations, ReactSpring for that springy touch and...there&apos;s
						too many more but you get the idea.
